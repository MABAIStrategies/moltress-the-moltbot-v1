# GitHub Project Post-Create Checklist (Views + Automation)

After running `project/gh-bootstrap.sh`, complete these steps in the GitHub UI.

## Create Views
1. **Board**
   - Layout: Board
   - Group by: **Status**
   - Filter: is:issue
2. **Roadmap**
   - Layout: Roadmap
   - Group by: **Phase**
3. **Triage**
   - Layout: Table
   - Columns: Title, Status, Phase, Component, Priority, Risk, Sprint
   - Sort: Priority asc, Risk desc

## Automation (Optional)
Depending on your GitHub org/project settings, configure:
- New item added -> Status=Backlog
- PR opened (linked) -> Status=Review
- PR merged -> Status=Done

If unavailable, enforce via process (PR template + weekly triage).

## Import Issues
- Full catalog: `project/github-issues-expanded.csv`
- Seed list: `project/github-issues.csv`

## Add Issues to Project
Select all issues -> “Add to project” -> choose your created project.

## Suggested cadence
- Weekly sprint planning (30 min)
- Mid-sprint checkpoint review (15 min)
- End-of-sprint demo + security checklist (30–45 min)

# GitHub Project v2 Bootstrap (GraphQL + gh CLI)

This repo provides scripts/templates to bootstrap:
- Labels
- Milestones
- A GitHub Project v2 with core fields

## Prereqs
- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
- `python3`, `jq`
- Token scopes:
  - `repo`
  - `project`
  - `read:org` (if org-owned project)

## Limitations (be aware)
GitHub Projects v2 APIs can change; and some "views" / automation rules are only configurable via UI depending on org settings.
This package includes:
- A script to create the project and fields
- JSON to apply labels + milestones
- A post-create checklist to configure views/automation quickly in the UI

Run:
1) `bash project/gh-bootstrap.sh --owner <OWNER> --repo <REPO> --project "MoltBot Ops — Delivery"`
2) Follow the post-create checklist output
